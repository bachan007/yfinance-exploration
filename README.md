# yfinance-exploration

In this project i am going to write multiple scripts to get the information about the stocks which i usually get after too much research or putting much efforts. 
I have created the modules to gather the information and now i just need to put the stock symbol, and then i can get all the information into a single pdf file.

Although most of the scripts can run seperately, but i have created a main file named stock_update.py, which will give me the options of all the scripts.

For running the scripts, you need python 3.
Simply clone the project and create a virtual environment using
> python3 -m venv 'path of environment'

and activate the virtual environment

Install the required libraries using 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

run the scripts using :
> python3 script_name.py


#### Explanation for stock_update.py

In this file i am getting the information using multiple files and storing the info into a single pdf for my understanding.
