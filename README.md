# yfinance-exploration

In this project i am going to write multiple scripts to get the information about the stocks which i usually get after too much research or putting much efforts. 

For running the scripts, you need python 3.
Simply clone the project and create a virtual environment using
> python3 -m venv 'path of environment'

and activate the virtual environment

Install the required libraries using 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

run the scripts using :
> python3 script_name.py

### Here, i will explain the functionality for every script.

#### Explanation for dividend-analysis.py

In this file i am analysing the dividend history of the the stocks.
